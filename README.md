# Jukebox-Extended
We will start from an extended database schema called “ChinookDatabase” with some information about Playlists and Customers (like iTunes has).

1. Map the new tables on the Database Schema
2. Write the SQL queries to answer these questions:
   - List all customers (name + email), ordered alphabetically (no extra information)
   - List tracks (Name + Composer) of the **Classical** playlist
   - List the **10** artists **mostly listed** in all playlists
   - List the tracks which have been purchased at least **twice**, ordered by number of purchases
